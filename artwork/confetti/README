To re-generate the confetti animations, open confetti.blend in blender and run
the "Render Animation" command.  This will create a series of .png files, one
per frame, in /tmp.

From the derbynet directory, run:

artwork/confetti/encode.sh

to generate a .webm and a .mov version in the website directory.
