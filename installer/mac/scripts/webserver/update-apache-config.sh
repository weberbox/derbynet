# This script updates the configuration files for the built-in Apache server.
# It's tested at least to work with the Apache configuration as installed by
# macOS 10.13 (High Sierra).
#
# On a Mac that already has non-trivial configuration changes, this script may
# not have the desired effect, but it should be trivial to identify and correct
# any unwanted changes.

# This enables PHP processing by uncommenting two lines in the Apache web
# server's configuration file, then enables two other modules to support SSH
# handling.
